        Hi! My name is <span class="text-orange-400">Bryan Jade</span> and I enjoy working with web development.
        My interest in web development started back in 2018, 
        since then I decided to recreate Instagram with basic functions 
        such as <span class="text-orange-400">C.R.U.D.</span> (create, read, update, and depete) - turns out that by 
        recreating the things that already build helps me grow by understanding its concepts and flows.
      </p>
      <p class="mx-4 py-4">
        Fast-forward to this day, I've had the privilege of working at <a href="https://www.xiklab.com/" target="_blank" class="text-orange-400">a digital marketing agency</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/Meraqi-Software"  target="_blank" class="text-orange-400">a start-up</a>,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/highlysucceed"  target="_blank" class="text-orange-400">a huge corporation</a>, and <a href="#" target="_blank" class="text-orange-400">some individual projects</a>.
        My main focus these days is taking another path with DevOps for cloud computing and self reliant servers.
